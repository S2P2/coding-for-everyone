### Argument
The actual value you "pass into" a function when you call it. If a recipe's parameter is `(type_of_flour)`, the argument you use when cooking might be `"whole wheat"`.

### Array / List
A single variable that holds an ordered collection of multiple items. Think of it as a **shopping list** where the order of items is preserved. Lists are almost always **zero-indexed**.

### Assignment Operator (`=`)
The equals sign (`=`) in programming. It's an action, not a question. It means "put the value on the right into the variable on the left." It's the act of filling a **prep bowl**.

### Boolean
A data type that can only have one of two values: `true` or `false`. Think of it as a light switch that is either on or off.

### Call (a function)
The act of running a function that has been defined. This is like deciding to follow a recipe card you have on file.

### Code
The set of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what to do. The "recipe" for the computer.

### Comment
A note written in the code for humans to read. The computer completely ignores comments. They are the "notes in the margin" of your recipe.

### Compiler
A program that translates your entire source code into a machine-readable format *before* you run it. This is like translating a whole cookbook into another language before giving it to a chef. Languages like Rust, Go, and C# are compiled.

### Concatenation
The process of joining two or more strings together to create a new, longer string. For example, `"Hello" + " " + "World!"` becomes `"Hello World!"`.

### Data Type
The category that a piece of information belongs to. The most common types are **strings** (text), **numbers** (integers/floats), and **booleans** (true/false). Think of them as the basic **food groups** of programming.

### Define (a function)
The act of creating a function and giving it a name and a set of instructions. This is like writing down a new recipe on a card and filing it away for later use.

### Dictionary / Map / Object
A collection of **key-value pairs**. Instead of accessing items by their numerical position (like in a list), you access them by a unique name (the key). Think of it as a **recipe card**, where you look for the label "Cook Time" to find the value "30 minutes".

### Function
A named, reusable block of code that performs a specific task. You **define** it once and can **call** it many times. It's your "kitchen station" for a repeatable process.

### IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
A software application that provides comprehensive tools for programmers, typically including a code editor, a debugger, and build automation tools. Examples include VS Code, PyCharm, and Visual Studio.

### If/Else Statement
A fundamental control flow structure that allows a program to make decisions. If a condition is true, one block of code runs; otherwise (else), a different block of code runs. It's the "taste and adjust" step in a recipe.

### Import
The act of bringing external code, like a **library** or **module**, into your program so you can use its functions. This is like getting a powerful "kitchen gadget" to use in your own kitchen.

### Index
The numerical position of an item in a **list** or **array**. In programming, the index almost always starts at `0`, not `1`. So, the first item is at index `0`, the second at index `1`, and so on.

### Infinite Loop
A common bug where a loop's ending condition is never met, causing it to run forever. This will cause your program to freeze or crash. It's like a kitchen mixer you can't turn off.

### Interpreter
A program that reads and executes your code one line at a time. It's like a chef who has a recipe translated for them as they cook. Languages like Python and JavaScript are interpreted.

### Key-Value Pair
The fundamental structure inside a **dictionary**. A unique `key` (a string label) is paired with a `value` (the data). For example, in `"name": "Tomato Soup"`, `"name"` is the key and `"Tomato Soup"` is the value.

### Library / Module
A collection of pre-written functions and tools that you can **import** into your program to perform common tasks without having to write the code yourself. Think of them as your programming "kitchen gadgets."

### Loop (`for`, `while`)
A control structure that repeats a block of code multiple times.
-   A **`for` loop** is used to iterate over every item in a collection (e.g., "for each step in the recipe...").
-   A **`while` loop** is used to repeat an action as long as a certain condition is true (e.g., "while the water is not boiling...").

### Parameter
A placeholder in a function's definition that acts as a variable inside the function. It's the named "ingredient" on the recipe card, like `(cook_time)`. When you **call** the function, you provide an **argument** for that parameter.

### Programming Language
A formal language with specific rules (**syntax**) that humans use to write instructions for a computer. Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Rust.

### Return Value
The value that a function "sends back" to the code that called it. This allows functions to produce results that can be stored in variables and used elsewhere. It's the finished "dish" (like a sauce) that a recipe produces.

### String
A data type used to represent text. A string is a sequence of characters surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., `"Hello, World!"`).

### Syntax
The set of rules, principles, and processes that govern the structure of sentences in a given language. In programming, it's the "grammar" you must follow for the computer to understand your code.

### Variable
A named container for storing a piece of information. Using a variable is like putting an ingredient in a labeled **prep bowl**.

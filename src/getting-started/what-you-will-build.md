### What You'll Build

Every great chef starts with a simple, rewarding recipe. By the end of this guide's core concepts, you won't just know theoryâ€”you'll have built your very first interactive program from scratch.

Welcome to the **Secret Ingredient Challenge!**

It's a fun game where you, the master baker, must discover the perfect baking temperature for a rare and mysterious ingredient. The computer will think of a secret temperature, and it's your job to guess it before you run out of ingredients!

Each time you make a guess, the program will give you feedback:

*   "Too cold! The cake is gooey."
*   "Too hot! The cake is burnt to a crisp!"
*   "Perfection! The cake is golden-brown and delicious."

### The Skills You'll Learn

This project isn't just for fun; it's a practical test of all the core "kitchen skills" you'll learn in this guide. To build this game, you'll master how to:

1.  **Store Information:** You'll use **variables** to keep track of the secret temperature and the number of guesses you have left.
2.  **Talk to the User:** You'll learn how to get **user input** by asking the player for their guess.
3.  **Make Decisions:** You'll use **if/else logic** to check if the guess is too high, too low, or exactly right.
4.  **Repeat Actions:** You'll use **loops** to allow the player to keep guessing until they win or run out of attempts.
5.  **Use "Kitchen Gadgets":** You'll **import** a code library to generate a new random temperature every time the game is played.

It might sound like a lot now, but don't worry. Each concept in the coming modules is another tool for your kitchen. We'll guide you through every step, and by the end, you'll have a finished project that proves you can think like a programmer.

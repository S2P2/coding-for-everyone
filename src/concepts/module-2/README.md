# Prepping Your Ingredients: Data and Operations

Now that you know how to set up your kitchen with variables, it's time to learn about your ingredients. In programming, your "ingredients" are the different types of data you'll work with.

This module introduces you to the basic food groups of programming.

* **The Food Groups (Data Types)**: You'll learn to distinguish between different kinds of information, like text, whole numbers, and simple `true` or `false` values. Just as you wouldn't bake a cake with salt instead of sugar, using the right data type is crucial for a successful recipe.
* **The Kitchen Scale (Simple Math)**: Computers are excellent calculators. We'll see how to perform basic arithmetic, turning your code into a powerful tool for measuring and combining numerical ingredients.
* **Chopping and Combining (Working with Text)**: You'll learn fundamental ways to slice and combine pieces of text, an essential skill for creating messages, labels, or any text that people will read.

Let's start prepping our ingredients.

# Prepping Your Ingredients: Data and Operations

Now that you know how to set up your kitchen with variables, it's time to learn about your ingredients. In programming, the "ingredients" are the different types of data you work with.

This module introduces you to the basic food groups of code.

* **Core Data Types**: You'll learn to distinguish between different kinds of information, like text, whole numbers, and simple `true` or `false` values. Just as you wouldn't bake a cake with salt instead of sugar, using the right data type is crucial.
* **Simple Math**: Computers are excellent calculators. We'll see how to perform basic arithmetic, turning your code into a powerful tool for working with numbers.
* **Working with Text**: You'll learn the most common way to combine pieces of text, a fundamental skill for creating messages, labels, or any user-facing output.

Let's start stocking our pantry.

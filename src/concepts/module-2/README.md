# Prepping Your Ingredients: Data and Operations

Now that you know how to set up your kitchen with variables, it's time to learn about your ingredients. In programming, your "ingredients" are the different types of data you'll work with.

This module introduces you to the basic food groups of programming.

* **The Food Groups (Data Types)**: You'll learn to distinguish between different kinds of information, like text, whole numbers, and simple `true` or `false` values. Just as you wouldn't bake a cake with salt instead of sugar, using the right data type is crucial for a successful recipe.
* **The Kitchen Scale (Simple Math)**: Computers are excellent calculators. We'll see how to perform basic arithmetic, turning your code into a powerful tool for measuring and combining numerical ingredients.
* **Chopping and Combining (Working with Text)**: You'll learn the most common ways to work with text, like joining it together, checking its length, and changing its case. These are essential skills for preparing any text that your user will see.

Let's start prepping our ingredients.

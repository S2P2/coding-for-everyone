# Following the Recipe (Logic & Flow)

In the last module, we learned about our ingredients (data types). Now, it's time to learn how to follow a recipe. A recipe isn't just a list of ingredients; it has instructions that tell you *when* and *why* to do things. "If the water is boiling, add pasta." "Wait until the oven is preheated."

This is the core of **logic** and **control flow**. You're telling the computer not just *what* to do, but how to make decisions along the way.

* **Comparison Operators (Asking Questions)**: This is how you check the state of your kitchen. Is the oven hot enough? Do we have enough eggs? Your code asks a question, and the answer is always a simple `true` or `false`.
* **Making Decisions (If/Else Statements)**: This is the recipe instruction itself. **If** the oven is hot enough, put the cookies in. **Else** (otherwise), wait five more minutes. It's how your code reacts based on the answers to its questions.

Let's start telling our program how to think.

# Organizing Your Kitchen (Functions & Imports)

As you write more code, your programs can start to look like a messy kitchen during a holiday dinner. Instructions are everywhere, steps are repeated, and finding the one thing you need becomes a huge chore. A great chef isn't just someone who can cookâ€”it's someone who keeps their kitchen organized.

This module is all about cleaning up our code. We'll learn how to bundle reusable steps into their own neat packages, making our programs easier to write, read, and debug.

* **Functions (Creating Reusable Blocks)**: This is your master recipe. Instead of rewriting the 10 steps for "perfect pizza dough" every time you want a pizza, you create one master recipe. Then, you can just refer to it by name.
* **Functions with Parameters (Passing Data)**: This is how you make your master recipe flexible. What if you want to make a whole wheat dough or a gluten-free dough? By adding placeholders for ingredients (parameters), your single master recipe can handle many variations.

Let's learn how to code like a head chef.

# Prep Bowls (Variables)

A variable is a labeled container for a piece of information, like using a labeled bowl for an ingredient. This practice, known in cooking as *mise en place*, keeps your code organized and easy to read.

The equals sign (`=`) is the **assignment operator**. It's an action, not a question. It means: "Put the value on the right into the container on the left."

```python
# Create a variable 'number_of_eggs' and assign the value 3 to it.
number_of_eggs = 3

# Now we can use the variable's name to get its value.
# This will display the number 3.
print(number_of_eggs)
```

```js
// Create a variable 'number_of_eggs' and assign the value 3 to it.
let number_of_eggs = 3;

// Now we can use the variable's name to get its value.
// This will display the number 3.
console.log(number_of_eggs);
```

By using variables, you can store information and refer to it by name anywhere in your program.

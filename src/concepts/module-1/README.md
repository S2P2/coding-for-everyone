# Mise en Place (The Basics)

Welcome to your first module\! Think of this as learning your way around a new kitchen. We'll cover the three most essential concepts you need before you can start cooking up code.

* **The Microwave 'Ding!' (Displaying Output)**: This is how your program communicates, like the "ding\!" of a microwave. It's the simplest way to confirm your kitchen is set up and working.
* **Taking an Order (User Input)**: This is how your program listens, like a waiter taking a customer's order. It allows the user to provide information.
* **Prep Bowls (Variables)**: These are your labeled prep bowls for ingredients (data), keeping everything organized and easy to find when your recipe calls for it.
* **Notes in the Margin (Comments)**: These are notes for yourself or others, like scribbling "use less salt" in a cookbook's margin. The computer ignores them completely.

Let's get started.

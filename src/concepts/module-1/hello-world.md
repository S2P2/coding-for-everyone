# The Microwave 'Ding!' (Displaying Output)

A simple way to display output from the computer to the screen.

Think of this as the "ding!" from your microwave. It's the simplest way for your program to tell you that it's on and working.

<!-- langtabs-start -->

```python
print("Ding!")
```

```javascript
console.log("Ding!");
```

<!-- langtabs-end -->

Try changing the message inside the quotation marks and running the code. You've just served your first "dish"!

# Cooking in Batches (Collections & Loops)

So far, we've handled our ingredients one at a time. But a real recipe isn't about a single ingredient; it's about a list of ingredients and a sequence of steps. To cook for real, you need to work with items in batches and perform repetitive actions.

This module is where our simple kitchen prep scales up to a full-blown cooking session. We'll learn how to handle groups of data and how to perform actions on every item in the group without writing the same code over and over.

* **Storing Multiple Items (Arrays & Lists)**: This is your recipe card. Instead of having a separate piece of paper for each instruction, you have one card that holds all the steps in an ordered list.
* **Looping Through Data (For Loops)**: This is the act of cooking itself. Itâ€™s the process of reading your recipe card and performing each step, one-by-one, from start to finish. It's how you automate repetitive work.

Let's start cooking for real.
